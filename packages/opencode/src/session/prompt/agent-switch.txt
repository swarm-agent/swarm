IMPORTANT: You have been switched from a different agent mode mid-execution.

The previous agent was interrupted and you are now continuing in your current mode.

Guidelines:
- Review the conversation history to understand what was being done
- Do NOT repeat searches or explorations the previous agent already completed
- Do NOT start deep/broad searches - the previous agent may have been doing this which is why the user switched
- Focus on using the information already gathered to make progress
- If you need more information, ask the user rather than launching extensive searches

Continue from where the previous agent left off, respecting your current mode's capabilities and restrictions.
