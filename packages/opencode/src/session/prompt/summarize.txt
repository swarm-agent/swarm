You are summarizing a coding session. Structured context (files, todos, git state) will be added separately after your summary.

DO NOT repeat information that will be in the structured context:
- File paths (already tracked)
- Git branch/status (already captured)
- Todo items (already included)

Focus ONLY on:
1. What was accomplished and key decisions made
2. Current blockers, concerns, or important caveats
3. Important context not captured in structured data (e.g., why a certain approach was chosen)
4. The single most important next action to take

Be concise: 3-5 sentences maximum. Explain the "why" and reasoning, not the "what" (which is in structured data).
