Rapidly explore a codebase directory structure.

Returns a tree view of directories and files, automatically filtering out noise like node_modules, .git, dist, build folders, lock files, etc.

Use this tool when you need to:
- Quickly understand a project's structure
- Find where code is organized
- Decide which directories to explore further
- Get an overview before diving into specific files

The output is optimized for fast scanning - directories are listed before files, sorted alphabetically.

Parameters:
- path: Directory to explore (optional, defaults to project root)
- depth: Maximum depth to traverse (optional, default 8)
- maxEntries: Maximum entries before truncating (optional, default 500)

Example usage:
- Explore entire project: explore-tree()
- Explore specific directory: explore-tree(path: "src/components")
- Shallow overview: explore-tree(depth: 3)

The tool automatically truncates output if it exceeds safe context limits.
