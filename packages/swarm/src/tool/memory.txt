Update the project's AGENTS.md file with new learnings, patterns, or important information.

Use this tool to persist knowledge that should be remembered across sessions. The AGENTS.md file serves as the project's persistent memory for AI agents.

## When to Use This Tool

- When you discover an important pattern or convention in the codebase
- When the user shares critical information about how things work
- When you learn something that future sessions should know
- After completing significant work that changes the architecture
- When you find gotchas, edge cases, or non-obvious behaviors

## Sections You Can Update

- **notes**: General learnings, gotchas, important decisions (most common)
- **architecture**: Project structure, key patterns, technology stack
- **commands**: Build, test, lint commands
- **style**: Code conventions, naming patterns, formatting rules
- **session**: Brief log entry of what was done (auto-dated)

## Examples

Add a learning about error handling:
```
memory({ section: "notes", content: "API errors return { error: string, code: number } format - always check .code for retry logic" })
```

Log significant work:
```
memory({ section: "session", content: "Refactored auth module to use JWT tokens" })
```

Update architecture info:
```
memory({ section: "architecture", content: "Event bus pattern: all cross-module communication goes through src/bus/" })
```

## Rules

1. Keep entries concise - one line or short paragraph
2. Don't duplicate existing information
3. Focus on non-obvious things that would help future sessions
4. Session entries are auto-dated
