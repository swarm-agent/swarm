- Fetches content from a specified URL
- Takes a URL and a prompt as input
- Fetches the URL content, converts HTML to markdown
- Returns the model's response about the content
- Use this tool when you need to retrieve and analyze web content

Usage notes:
  - IMPORTANT: Prefer `websearch` and `webcontents` tools when available - they use Exa AI for smarter content extraction
  - The URL must be a fully-formed valid URL
  - HTTP URLs will be automatically upgraded to HTTPS
  - The prompt should describe what information you want to extract from the page
  - This tool is read-only and does not modify any files
  - Content is truncated to maxCharacters (default: 50000) to prevent context overflow
  - Use lower maxCharacters values when doing many fetches to preserve context space
