Spawn a background agent to work on a task independently while you continue with other work.

The background agent runs asynchronously - this tool returns immediately after spawning, allowing you to continue working on other tasks without waiting.

Use this when:
- A task can run in parallel without blocking your main work
- You want to delegate a self-contained task that doesn't need back-and-forth interaction
- You have multiple independent tasks that could benefit from parallel execution
- The task is well-defined and doesn't require iterative feedback

The background agent will:
- Run completely independently in its own session
- Have access to the same tools (except spawning more background agents)
- Show progress in the background agents indicator
- Notify when complete via toast notification
- Be visible in the session list as a child session

Limitations:
- Maximum 5 concurrent background agents
- Cannot spawn nested background agents (no recursion)
- Cannot interact with parent session after spawning
- Results must be reviewed in the child session

Available agents:
{agents}
