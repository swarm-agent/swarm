- Fetch full content from specific URLs found via websearch
- Use this AFTER websearch to get detailed content from promising results
- Returns clean text content from web pages
- Supports fetching multiple URLs in one call (up to 5)
- Requires Exa API key (same as websearch)

Usage workflow:
1. Use `websearch` to find relevant pages
2. Review the summaries returned
3. Use `webcontents` with specific URLs to get full text

Content modes:
  - 'smart' (default): Returns LLM-generated summaries + key highlights. Compact but extracts the most relevant information.
  - 'full': Returns complete text content. Use when you need the entire page.

This is more efficient than fetching everything - only get details you need.
